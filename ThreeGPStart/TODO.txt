WHAT I DID LAST TIME

I made the skybox, currently ive mishmashed the render header and the skybox model, these should be seperate so im not using the same vector for the skypig model
currently ive made a new Model called skyBoxModel in order to circumvent re-organising the program. This wont alst long however. I should get to tidying up ASAP.
